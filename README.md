## Project 3
Here is my Custom Counter App!
This is a simple counter application that I have built using Next.js. This feautures a customizable counter with increments, rest, and adjustable step size, all styled wtih CSS.

## Getting Started
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
